# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment
#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
 Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality softwares.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
 Development of programming languages such as Fotran and C 
 Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
 Advent of structured programming inthe 1970s
 The rise of the agile methodologies inthe 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 Requirements: gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
 Design: creating high level designs of the software 
 Implementation: is the process of writing code to develop the software required 
 Testing: conducting various tests to ensure the software meets the required standard quality and requirements
 Deployment: releasing the software to the users or customers
 Maintenance: this is ensuring that the code continues to run error free and if updates are required be done

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall manages quality through detailed planning and extensive testing at the end of the development phase. Agile, on the other hand, allows continuous integration and testing to assure quality right through the development process. Both assume that the final product should be defect-free and meet quality standards


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team. 

Software developer's create the computer applications that allow users to do specific tasks and the underlying systems that run the devices or control networks.
Software Quality Assuarance engineer roles are to design test plans, scenarios, scripts, or procedures. Document software defects, using a bug tracking system, and report defects to software developers. Identify, analyze, and document problems with program function, output, online screen, or content.
Project manager is responsible for guiding and mentoring your software development team so they successfully meet project goals.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently. It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application. Example is Microsoft Visual Studio
Version control is crucial in software development as it efficiently manages and tracks changes to code over time, facilitating team collaboration and project progress tracking. Example is GIT.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines : allocate enough time for the project by plannning ahead.
Changin requirements: ensure that the use methods like agile 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is the testing of individual components or modules of a software
Intergration testing is testing interactions between different components or subsystems
System testing is testing of the entire software system as a whole
Acceptance testing is testing software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 
It makes writing code easier
It ensures getting the right answer
Helps avoid vague answers

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
